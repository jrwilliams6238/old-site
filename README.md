## Education			        		
**B.S. Computer Science**  
Georgia Institute of Technology (_Aug. 2019 - May 2023_)

## Work Experience
**Machine Learning Engineer Intern**  
Institute of People and Technology (_Summer 2022_)
  - Analyzed sensitive student records, modeling the relationship between personal data, student-staff emails, and GPA
  - Used **PyTorch** and **Pandas** for natural language processing (**NLP**), enabling sentiment analysis of student-staff emails
  - Utilized **Seaborn** to create compact visualizations of individual students, efficiently displaying nine variables across time
  - Used **R** to measure the statistical significance of apparent trends, detecting bias in GPA across zip code and gender

**Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist**  
AI-CARING (_Jan. 2021 - Sep. 2021_)
- Led the analysis of “Aware Homes,” studying dozens of patients through hundreds of sensors in their own houses
- Outperformed faulty medicine tracker by utilizing ambient sensors (vibration, light, doors) in a deep recurrent model
- Managed data from thousands of unique sensors, creating a pipeline from **AWS** to **PyTorch** to facilitate ML analysis

**SURF Intern, Data Science Intern**  
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (_Summer 2020_)
- Developed tools for the **NLP** of COVID-19 abstracts, classifying articles for meta-analysis at the start of the pandemic
- Designed a **TensorFlow**-based model for the classification of articles given tf-idf n-gram representations of abstracts

## Projects
**Recommend.US**, a Create-X Startup  
[Future Link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobwilliams314/)
- Invented a recommender system where users add/subtract/average books and movies to receive novel suggestions
- Scraped the text of every documented movie’s Wikipedia article, creating an embedded representation of each film
- Rapidly prototyped minimum viable product using **Figma** and **React**. Coordinated efforts with Agile, Colab, and Git

**Analysis of Aware Homes**  
[Future Link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobwilliams314/)
- Utilized **Pandas** and **TensorFlow** to create deep recurrent models capable of labeling activity from live sensor data
- Developed clustering methods for unsupervised activity detection, bootstrapping the training of supervised models

**3D Printed Logic Gates**  
[Future Link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobwilliams314/)
- Invented a 3D-printed gear logic system. Prototyped with **CircuitSim**, simulated using **C++**, and modeled in **AutoCAD**
