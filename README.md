#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, AWS, Snowflake, MATLAB

## Education			        		
**B.S., Computer Science | Georgia Institute of Technology (_Aug. 2019 - May. 2023_)**

## Work Experience
**Machine Learning Engineer Intern @ Institute of People and Technology (Summer 2022)**
- Analyzed sensitive student records, modeling the relationship between personal data, student-staff emails, and GPA
- Used PyTorch and Pandas for natural language processing (NLP), enabling sentiment analysis of student-staff emails
- Utilized Seaborn to create compact visualizations of individual students, efficiently displaying 9 variables across time
- Used R to measure the statistical significance of apparent trends, detecting bias in GPA across zip code and gender

**Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist @ AI-CARING (_Jan. 2021 - Sep. 2021_)**
- Led the analysis of “Aware Homes,” studying dozens of patients through hundreds of sensors in their own houses
- Outperformed faulty medicine tracker by utilizing ambient sensors (vibration, light, doors) in a deep recurrent model
- Managed data from thousands of unique sensors, creating a pipeline from AWS to PyTorch to facilitate ML analysis

**SURF Intern, Data Scientist @ Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (Summer 2020_)**
- Developed tools for the NLP of COVID-19 abstracts, classifying articles for meta-analysis at the start of the pandemic
- Designed a TensorFlow-based model for the classification of articles given tf-idf n-gram representations of abstracts

## Projects
